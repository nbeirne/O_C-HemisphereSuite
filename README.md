### My changes
- Remove Enigma, Darkest Timeline, MIDI support. 
- Add in Sequins from the original O_C firmware
- Allow the dual clock divider to have arbitrary divisions (-8-+8, then +16, and +32). Configured in the code.
- Add a SwitchSeq app which runs 4 sequences in parallel where CV picks which sequence is run, or octave switches, or is quantized directly.



### firmware:

Hemisphere Suite is an open-source project by Jason Justian (aka chysn)

ornament**s** & crime**s** is a collaborative project by Patrick Dowling (aka pld), mxmxmx and Tim Churches (aka bennelong.bicyclist) (though mostly by pld and bennelong.bicyclist). it **(considerably) extends** the original firmware for the o_C / ASR eurorack module, designed by mxmxmx.

### hardware:

eurorack / teensy 3.2 DAC8565 quad 16bit CV module w/ OLED display

14HP, depth ~ 25mm
